Pre thoughts
---------------------
I am excited to implement an algorithm to solve an actual problem. Though at
this stage I don't know which algorithm I should choose. I know this will take
a lot of thought so rather than rush into the coding I'm actually going to
behave and write myself a plan on a piece of paper.

Post thoughts
---------------------
The plan helped tremendously. Thinking ahead really pays off. I knew I wanted to
go with bfs instead of dfs to avoid infinite loops. The move list was easy to
work out too. I had some trouble with working out how to get the route. All the
bfs did was return the value of the endpoint, which is useless alone (we already
know the end point.) But a good search online pointed me towards building the
root 'backwards'. the bfs gave us the endpoint with a parent node. and that
had a parent node etc until the start point. and that's how I could build a
route

Overall I'm pretty proud of myself, particularly my urge to keep at it and
researching. I learnt quite a lot in this project. And I'm excited for actually
building a game of chess.
